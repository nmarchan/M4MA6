# M4MA6
Collection of Python code from ITSE-1329 Module 4 Mastery Assessments

M4MA2 shows the continuing refinement of a script that defines "User" and "Restaurant" classes, with m4ma2.py containing the final form of the script, while the '_q*' variants represent different objectives along the way. 

M4MA3 contains two scripts: one in which a die is rolled ten times, and another in which four characters are randomly selected to represent a lottery. Both require importing the built-in random module.

M4MA4 contains two scripts as well. The learning_python script contains code to read text from a file and print it in several different ways. CUBE.py uses the third-party Matplotlib library to plot the cubes of 5 and then 5000 positive integers, with some error handling for some inconsistent matplotlib errors that cropped up.

M4MA5 has two scripts: M4A5_q1 uses Pygal to create a histogram visualization of 4 earthquakes and their magnitudes. M4A5_q2 uses the matplotlib and (built-in) csv modules to plot the locations of fires detected worldwide over a 24-hour period.
